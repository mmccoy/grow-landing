# Setting up the Google Form

In order to make the signup form work, you have to go through a few steps to create
a few Google Docs:

1. A google form with one field, 'Email Address'.
2. A google spreadsheet to collect the email address submissions.

Once this is done, replace the variables 'form_key' and 'field_id' in home.md with your values.

## form_key
This is a string that identifies the Google Form to post to. ie, 1x_rILp6UvJXVLiYMY9Ux8HB5OVQRwWIUeLW1kfZEwxU

## field_id
This is a value of the 'name' attribute on the rendered form. ie, entry.1147545766
